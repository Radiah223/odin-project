        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hot chocolate, also known as hot cocoa or drinking chocolate, is a 
            heated drink consisting of shaved or melted chocolate or cocoa 
            powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. It is often 
            garnished with whipped cream or marshmallows. Hot chocolate made 
            with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, 
            characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 and 3/4 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp fine sea salt</li>
            <li>8 ounces fine grated chocolate</li>
            <li>1 tbsp confectioner sugar</li>
            <em>Optional</em>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, whisk together the whole milk, heavy cream, 
            and salt. Place over medium-heat and cook just until the mixture 
            comes to a rolling simmer â€“ not a full boil.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and add in the chopped chocolate, 
            whisk well until the chocolate is completely melted. </li>
        <li>Return the saucepan to low heat. Stir in the confectioners' sugar 
            (and vanilla and cinnamon, if using) and cook, whisking constantly, 
            for 8 to 10 minutes, or until super thick and smooth.</li>
        <li>Ladle into mugs. Garnish with lots of whipped cream and shaved 
            chocolate, if desired. Serve at once!</li>
    </ol>
